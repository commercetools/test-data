We're removing the **sample data presets** from the `ProductType` model.
There are files we missed when we tried to remove all the sample data presets from this repository back in [this release](https://github.com/commercetools/test-data/releases/tag/%40commercetools%2Fcomposable-commerce-test-data%4012.0.0).

Remember we now how a new package (`@commercetools/composable-commerce-test-data-sample-presets`) where you can find them should you need them.
