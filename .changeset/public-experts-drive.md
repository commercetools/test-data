'@commercetools/composable-commerce-test-data': minor

We're changing how the internal `postBuild` callback used in the models definitions work.
You can read more about this function in [the docs](https://github.com/commercetools/test-data/blob/main/docs/contributing/test-data-models-overview.md#fields-config).

This refactor is internal and does not have any impact in the consumers.
