Fix properties in the rest model: customer, customerGroup, store, state and businessUnit. Added those properties to the graphql model.
Fixed some Rest model type properties types:

- customer
- customerGroup
- store
- state

Fixed the types of those same properties in the Graphql model typescript type.
