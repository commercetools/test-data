'@commercetools/composable-commerce-test-data': patch
---

The `CustomApplication`, `CustomApplicationDraft`, `CustomApplicationDeploymentPreview`, `CustomApplicationInstallation`, `CustomApplicationInstallationPermission`, `CustomApplicationMenuLink`, `CustomApplicationMenuLinkDraft`, `CustomApplicationPermission`, `CustomApplicationPermissionDraft`, `CustomApplicationSubmenuLink` and `CustomApplicationSubmenuLinkDraft` models have been refactored to use the new implementation patterns but that does not affect consumers.
