This repository contains data models within the commercetools platform ecosystem.

> In time, we will continue to implement and open source test data models. If you are interested or missing a specific data model, feel free to open a feature request or try to contribute to the repository.

Models are defined in the `models/*` workspace and are grouped by domain in different packages.

All models are built using the `core` package, which contains the necessary methods to implement and work with models. The `core` package is very much agnostic of the commercetools platform domain, so you can potentially use it to build your own models for other domains.

To know more about how to work and build data models, [check out the documentation of the `core` package](./core).

# Usage

Using models is pretty straightforward. You import the package and build the model, which returns the data in the requested shape.

For example, assuming we have an `Author` model from a `stories` package:

```ts
import type { TAuthor } from '@commercetools-test-data/stories';

import { Author } from '@commercetools-test-data/stories';

const author1 = Author.random().firstName('John').buildGraphql<TAuthor>();
const author2 = Author.random().firstName('Rebecca').buildGraphql<TAuthor>();
```

# Contribution

## Presets Folder

This isn't a hard rule, but for organization & ownership purposes, pangolin & fct typically house their presets under said folders (eg change-history-data, sample-data-foo). If someone would like to modify these presets, then the corresponding team review is mandatory

## FAQ

#### whose review is mandatory for creating PR?

For PR related to presets, individual team's approval should be just fine. If larger changes are made to the models themselves, it doesn't hurt to have a rep from other team review as well (just ping the channel `#test-data-migration` for a volunteer)

#### Can I simply copy/paste existing test model from other repository (eg: mc-frontend) to test-data?

We wonâ€™t tell you how to work your magic, but we would advise against a simple copy paste from other repository models, as it will create a bigger mess to clean up. Certain sections can perhaps be copied over as such (generator fields, portions of specs, etc), but the structure and composition vary considerably from what you currently have.

#### Is there a easy way to know which models are already available?

No, there is no overarching inventory page at this time the outlines each package with its corresponding models.
Each package contains the draft & final models that are grouped/organized by their representations as outlined in the docs.
Take cartDiscounts#representations for example. If youâ€™d like to review what has been created to date for underlying representations, you can just drill to the main [index](https://github.com/commercetools/test-data/blob/main/models/cart-discount/src/index.ts) of that package.

#### How do I test a new model (e.g, with my MC component spec) when I create?

Unfortunately, that part does become a bit more tedious.
Copy and pasting it into the node_modules folder is one option.
Another trick that we typically do is to add the new models locally in a separate file, make the call to it, then address any tweaks necessary.

#### What is the procedure after merging the PR?

For merged PRs, we have no set schedule for releasing VPs. It really depends on the traffic at the time. If you need something immediately, you are more than welcome to ping the group to see if there are any objections to a release. Once the VP is released, you can grab it immediately for your repository(eg: mc-frontend), or you can just wait for the dep updates to go through (e.g [update all test-data packages to v6.10.0](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-frontend/pull/16069))
